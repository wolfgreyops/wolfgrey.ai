## POST 1 - ROI/Results
**Schedule:** Thursday

```
Last month I tracked every task I handed to Claude.

Result: 47 hours saved.

Not "productivity gains." Not "efficiency improvements."

47 actual hours I got back to spend on revenue-generating work.

Your competitors are already doing this.
```

## POST 2 - Tactical Tip
**Schedule:** Friday

```
Most AI prompts fail because they are too vague.

The fix: CRAFT

C - Context (who you are, what you do)
R - Role (who should Claude be)
A - Action (specific task)
F - Format (how you want the output)
T - Tone (voice and style)

One framework. Every prompt works better.
```

## POST 3 - Mindset Shift
**Schedule:** Saturday

```
Unpopular opinion:

Most small businesses do not need "AI strategy."

They need one workflow automated this week.

Then another next week.

Strategy is what you call it 6 months later when someone asks how you scaled.
```

## POST 4 - Tool/Workflow
**Schedule:** Sunday

```
My email workflow before Claude:
- Read email (2 min)
- Draft response (5 min)
- Edit and send (3 min)
- 10 min per email x 30 emails = 5 hours/day

After:
- Paste email to Claude with CRAFT prompt
- Edit output (1 min)
- Send
- 2 min per email = 1 hour/day

4 hours back. Every day.
```

## POST 5 - THREAD: 5 AI Workflows
**Schedule:** Monday (Thread - 7 tweets)

**Tweet 1:**
```
I have built AI workflows for 20+ small businesses.

These 5 pay for themselves in the first week.

No code. No developers. Just Claude and 30 minutes of setup.

Thread:
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
1/ Email Response Drafting

The setup: Create a CRAFT prompt with your typical email scenarios.

Time saved: 3-4 hours/week

ROI: A $49 Claude Pro subscription pays for itself by Wednesday.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
2/ Meeting Notes to Action Items

The setup: Paste transcript, ask for action items with owners and deadlines.

Time saved: 15 min per meeting

ROI: 5 meetings/week = 1.25 hours back. Plus nothing falls through the cracks.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
3/ First-Draft Proposals

The setup: Template with your services, pricing, and past wins. Claude customizes per prospect.

Time saved: 1-2 hours per proposal

ROI: Send 3 more proposals/week. Close 1. That is revenue, not just time.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
4/ Customer FAQ Responses

The setup: Feed Claude your FAQ doc. It drafts responses matching your voice.

Time saved: 30 min/day on repetitive questions

ROI: Your team stops context-switching. Focus time is worth more than you think.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
5/ Weekly Report Generation

The setup: Give Claude your data format. It writes the narrative.

Time saved: 2-3 hours/week

ROI: Reports go out on time. Clients stay informed. You stop dreading Fridays.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
These are not advanced use cases. They are the basics.

Start with one. Get the win. Add the next.

## POST 6 - Community
**Schedule:** Tuesday

```
Genuine question for operators using AI:

What is the ONE task you refuse to hand over to Claude?

For me it is final client communication. Always want my eyes on it before send.

What is yours?
```

## POST 7 - Soft Sell
**Schedule:** Wednesday

```
I put together 7 prompts that save small business owners 10+ hours/week.

Sales follow-ups. Content drafts. Meeting prep. Invoice reminders.

No fluff. Just copy, paste, edit, done.

Free: wolfgrey.ai/guide?src=twitter

Stop reading about AI. Start building with it.
```

## POST 8 - ROI/Results
**Schedule:** Thursday

```
Client runs a 6-person agency.

Before: 2 hours/day on proposal writing
After: 22 minutes

They are not sending fewer proposals. They are sending 3x more.

Same team. Same hours. More pipeline.

That is what AI implementation actually looks like.
```

---

## POST 9 - Tactical Tip
**Schedule:** Friday

```
Claude trick most people miss:

Start your prompt with "You are an expert [role] helping a [your context]..."

Then describe the task.

The role framing changes everything about the output quality.

Simple. Obvious once you know it. Makes every prompt better.
```

---

## POST 10 - Mindset Shift
**Schedule:** Saturday

```
The gap between "knows AI exists" and "uses AI daily" is about 3 hours of implementation.

Not 3 months of research.
Not waiting for the "right tool."
Not a 6-figure consulting engagement.

3 hours. One workflow. Then momentum takes over.
```

---

## POST 11 - Tool/Workflow
**Schedule:** Sunday

```
Built a free calculator that shows exactly how much time AI could save your business.

Input your tasks. Get hours back per week.

No email required. No sales pitch. Just math.

wolfgrey.ai/tools?src=twitter

Then decide if 10+ hours/week is worth 30 minutes of setup.
```

## POST 12 - THREAD: CRAFT Framework
**Schedule:** Monday (Thread - 6 tweets)

**Tweet 1:**
```
90% of prompts fail for the same reason:

Not enough context.

Here is the framework I use for every prompt.

It is called CRAFT. Takes 30 seconds to apply. Works every time.
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
C = Context

Tell Claude who you are and what you are working on.

Bad: "Write an email"
Good: "I run a 10-person marketing agency. We just finished a website redesign for a SaaS client."

Context shapes everything that follows.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
R = Role

Assign Claude an expert identity.

Bad: Just asking the question
Good: "Act as a senior copywriter with 15 years of B2B experience"

The role determines the depth and angle of the response.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
A = Action

Be specific about what you need.

Bad: "Help me with this email"
Good: "Draft a follow-up email to send 3 days after our proposal. Goal is to prompt a decision without being pushy."

Vague actions = vague outputs.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
F = Format + T = Tone

Tell Claude how to structure and deliver.

Format: "Bullet points" or "3 paragraphs" or "table with columns X, Y, Z"

Tone: "Professional but warm" or "Direct and concise"

These two eliminate 80% of rewrites.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
CRAFT in action:

Context + Role + Action + Format + Tone = prompts that work first try.

I built 40+ templates using this framework.
