## WEEK 1

---

### Monday (Week 1) - ROI/Results

**Theme:** Case study with specific numbers

```
Last month I tracked every task I handed to Claude.

Result: 47 hours saved.

Not "productivity gains." Not "efficiency improvements."

47 actual hours I got back to spend on revenue-generating work.

Your competitors are already doing this.

### Tuesday (Week 1) - Tactical Tip

**Theme:** CRAFT framework introduction

```
Most AI prompts fail because they're too vague.

The fix: CRAFT

C - Context (who you are, what you do)
R - Role (who should Claude be)
A - Action (specific task)
F - Format (how you want the output)
T - Tone (voice and style)

One framework. Every prompt works better.
```

### Wednesday (Week 1) - Mindset Shift

**Theme:** Hot take on AI adoption

```
Unpopular opinion:

Most small businesses don't need "AI strategy."

They need one workflow automated this week.

Then another next week.

Strategy is what you call it 6 months later when someone asks how you scaled.
```

### Thursday (Week 1) - Tool/Workflow

**Theme:** Specific workflow walkthrough

```
My email workflow before Claude:
- Read email (2 min)
- Draft response (5 min)
- Edit and send (3 min)
- 10 min per email x 30 emails = 5 hours/day

After:
- Paste email to Claude with CRAFT prompt
- Edit output (1 min)
- Send
- 2 min per email = 1 hour/day

4 hours back. Every day.
```

### Friday (Week 1) - Thread Day

**Theme:** Deep-dive educational thread (7 tweets)

**THREAD: 5 AI Workflows That Pay for Themselves in Week 1**

**Tweet 1/7:**
```
I've built AI workflows for 20+ small businesses.

These 5 pay for themselves in the first week.

No code. No developers. Just Claude and 30 minutes of setup.

2/ Meeting Notes to Action Items

3/ First-Draft Proposals

The setup: Template with your services, pricing, and past wins. Claude customizes per prospect.

```
**Character count:** 252

### Saturday (Week 1) - Community

**Theme:** Engagement question

```
Genuine question for operators using AI:

What's the ONE task you refuse to hand over to Claude?

For me it's final client communication. Always want my eyes on it before send.

What's yours?
```

**Character count:** 214

### Sunday (Week 1) - Soft Sell

**Theme:** Direct CTA to free guide

```
I put together 7 prompts that save small business owners 10+ hours/week.

Sales follow-ups. Content drafts. Meeting prep. Invoice reminders.

No fluff. Just copy, paste, edit, done.

Free: wolfgrey.ai/guide?src=twitter

Stop reading about AI. Start building with it.

## WEEK 2

---

### Monday (Week 2) - ROI/Results

**Theme:** Client result with specific numbers

```
Client runs a 6-person agency.

Before: 2 hours/day on proposal writing
After: 22 minutes

They're not sending fewer proposals. They're sending 3x more.

Same team. Same hours. More pipeline.

That's what AI implementation actually looks like.
```

**Character count:** 254

### Tuesday (Week 2) - Tactical Tip

**Theme:** Specific Claude trick

```
Claude trick most people miss:

Start your prompt with "You are an expert [role] helping a [your context]..."

Then describe the task.

The role framing changes everything about the output quality.

Simple. Obvious once you know it. Makes every prompt better.
```

**Character count:** 267

---

### Wednesday (Week 2) - Mindset Shift

**Theme:** Industry observation

```
The gap between "knows AI exists" and "uses AI daily" is about 3 hours of implementation.

Not 3 months of research.
Not waiting for the "right tool."
Not a 6-figure consulting engagement.

3 hours. One workflow. Then momentum takes over.
```

**Character count:** 263

---

### Thursday (Week 2) - Tool/Workflow

**Theme:** ROI Calculator promotion

```
Built a free calculator that shows exactly how much time AI could save your business.

Input your tasks. Get hours back per week.

No email required. No sales pitch. Just math.

wolfgrey.ai/tools?src=twitter

Then decide if 10+ hours/week is worth 30 minutes of setup.
```

### Friday (Week 2) - Thread Day

**Theme:** Deep-dive on CRAFT framework (6 tweets)

**THREAD: The CRAFT Framework - How to Write Prompts That Actually Work**

**Tweet 1/6:**
```
90% of prompts fail for the same reason:

Not enough context.

Here's the framework I use for every prompt.

It's called CRAFT. Takes 30 seconds to apply. Works every time.
```
**Character count:** 192

**Tweet 2/6:**
```
C = Context

Tell Claude who you are and what you're working on.

Bad: "Write an email"
Good: "I run a 10-person marketing agency. We just finished a website redesign for a SaaS client."

Context shapes everything that follows.
```
**Character count:** 245

**Tweet 3/6:**
```
R = Role

Assign Claude an expert identity.

Bad: Just asking the question
Good: "Act as a senior copywriter with 15 years of B2B experience"

The role determines the depth and angle of the response.
```
**Character count:** 224

**Tweet 4/6:**
```
A = Action

Be specific about what you need.

Bad: "Help me with this email"
Good: "Draft a follow-up email to send 3 days after our proposal. Goal is to prompt a decision without being pushy."

Vague actions = vague outputs.
```
**Character count:** 243

**Tweet 5/6:**
```
F = Format + T = Tone

Tell Claude how to structure and deliver.

Format: "Bullet points" or "3 paragraphs" or "table with columns X, Y, Z"

Tone: "Professional but warm" or "Direct and concise"

These two eliminate 80% of rewrites.
```
**Character count:** 253

**Tweet 6/6:**
```
CRAFT in action:

Context + Role + Action + Format + Tone = prompts that work first try.

I built 40+ templates using this framework.
