## POST 1 - Single Tweet

Most people write prompts like they're texting a coworker. Claude isn't your coworker. Give it context, give it constraints, give it examples. Watch the output quality triple.

## POST 2 - Single Tweet

Built our entire website with Claude Code in one day. No developers. No designers. No dependencies. Just prompts and iteration. The barrier to building isn't technical anymore. It's just starting.

**3.1**
The prompting framework that changed how we work with Claude:

CRAFT.

Context, Role, Action, Format, Tone.

Here's how each piece actually works:

**Character count: 167**

**3.2**
CONTEXT: What's the situation? What does Claude need to know?

Bad: "Write me an email"
Better: "I run a landscaping company. A client hasn't paid their invoice in 45 days. This is their second late payment."

**Character count: 234**

**3.3**
ROLE + ACTION: Who should Claude be, and what specifically should it do?

"Act as an accounts receivable specialist. Write a firm but professional payment reminder that preserves the relationship but creates urgency."

**Character count: 237**

**3.4**
FORMAT + TONE: How should the output look and feel?

"Keep it under 150 words. Direct but not aggressive. Include a specific deadline and next steps if payment isn't received."

**Character count: 184**

**3.5**
That email used to take me 20 minutes of staring at the screen. Now it takes 30 seconds.

Not because AI is magic. Because a structured prompt gets structured output.

Claude isn't replacing your judgment. It's replacing the 2 hours you spend doing things that don't require your judgment. Big difference.

Three Claude prompts we use every single week to run wolfgrey:

All three take under 60 seconds.

**Character count: 108**

**5.2**
1. Proposal drafts:

"I had a call with [client type]. Their main pain point is [X]. They need [deliverable]. Budget is around [Y]. Draft a 1-page proposal that leads with their problem, shows our solution, and ends with a clear next step."

**Character count: 259**

**5.3**
2. Meeting prep:

"I'm meeting with [person/company]. Here's what I know about them: [paste LinkedIn, website, or notes]. Give me 5 specific questions to ask and 3 ways we might help them based on what you see."

**Character count: 230**

**5.4**
3. Weekly review:

"Here's what I worked on this week: [brain dump]. Organize this into: completed, in progress, blocked. Then tell me the one thing I should prioritize next week and why."

Takes the Sunday Scaries down a notch.

## POST 6 - Single Tweet

"Claude Code is for developers" is the lie that's costing small business owners thousands in agency fees. I've never written a line of code. Built 3 automated workflows last month.

## POST 7 - Single Tweet

Spent 2 hours writing a client proposal last year. Rewrote it in Claude last week. Took 4 minutes. Same quality. Probably better.

The gap between "knows about AI" and "uses AI" is measured in hours saved.

**8.1**
The wolfgrey operating model:

One operator. One AI agent.

Here's what that actually looks like day-to-day:

**Character count: 119**

**8.2**
Morning: Claude drafts email responses, I review and send. 45 minutes of work becomes 10.

Midday: Claude Code builds a landing page while I'm on client calls. Zero context-switching.

**Character count: 215**

**8.3**
Afternoon: Client asks for a custom quote. Claude drafts the proposal from my notes. I tweak two sentences and send.

Evening: Claude summarizes my day and preps tomorrow's priority list.

**Character count: 219**

**8.4**
This isn't the future. It's Tuesday.

The tools exist. The playbooks exist. The only question is whether you'll use them or compete against people who do.

## POST 9 - Single Tweet

The best Claude prompt I ever wrote was 6 words:

"What questions should you ask me?"

Let it interview you. Then answer. Then ask it to do the thing.

## POST 10 - Single Tweet

Stop asking Claude to "help" you. Start telling it exactly what you need.

"Help me write an email" = vague output.
"Write a 3-sentence follow-up to a prospect who went quiet after our demo" = usable output.

Specificity is the whole game.
